Graphs:

Graphs are fundamental mathematical structures used to model relationships between objects.
They consist of nodes (also called vertices) connected by edges (also called links or arcs).
G(V, E)
V = Vertices of the graph.
E = Edges of the graph.


Undirected Graphs:

An undirected graph is a type of graph where connections between nodes (also known as vertices) have no
specific direction associated with them. In other words, the relationships between nodes are symmetric.
if node A is connected to node B, then node B is also connected to node A. Undirected graphs consist of a set
of vertices and a set of edges. The edges simply represent the relationships or connections between pairs of
vertices without any indication of direction. These graphs are often used to model relationships where the
relationship between two entities is mutual or bidirectional, such as friendships in a social network or
connections in a network of computers. 


Weighted Graphs:

Weighted graphs, on the other hand, assign a value or weight to each edge.
These weights could represent distances, costs, or any other relevant metric associated with the
relationship between nodes.Combining these concepts, you can have undirected graphs with weighted
edges, capturing not just the relationships between nodes but also the magnitude or significance of
those relationships. 


Spanning Trees:

A subgraph T of a undirected graph G = ( V, E ) is a spanning tree of G if it is a tree and contains every
vertex of G.


MST:

Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in an undirected connected weighted graph is a spanning tree of minimum
weight.
