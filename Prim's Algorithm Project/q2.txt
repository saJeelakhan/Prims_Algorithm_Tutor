
Prim's Algorithm:

It is a fundamental method in computer science used to find the minimum spanning tree of a connected,
undirected graph.This algorithm efficiently selects edges that form a tree with the smallest possible total
weight while reaching all the nodes in the graph.By iteratively growing the tree from an initial node,
Prim's Algorithm guarantees the construction of the minimum spanning tree making it invaluable in various
applications, especially in network design, where minimizing costs or distances is crucial.

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.
It was developed in 1930 by Czech mathematician Vojtech Jarnik and later rediscovered and republished by
computer scientists Robert C. Prim in 1957 and E. W. Dijkstra in 1959. Therefore, it is also sometimes called
the DJP algorithm, Jarik's algorithm, the Prim-Jarnik algorithm,or the Prim-Dijkstra algorithm.
