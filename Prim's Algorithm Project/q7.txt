Prim's algorithm is used in computer networks for designing efficient communication networks, 
such as in routing protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). It's also employed in image 
segmentation for computer vision applications, ensuring optimal connectivity between pixels.
Additionally, the algorithm finds applications in circuit design, minimizing wire lengths on printed
circuit boards for more efficient and cost-effective layouts.
